Command line application written in Ruby that encrypts and decrypts strings with a key. It is based on two methods described
 in the book: Cryptography and Network Security Principles and Practices, 4th Ed by William Stallings.

Instructions:
1. Run the application in console.
2. Choose what you want to do (e to Encrypt, d to Decrypt).
3. Insert the string you want to Encrypt or Decrypt.
4. Insert the key you want to encrypt/decrypt with.
5. The result string is after the text "El texto encriptado es: " (Note the space at the end).

Notes:
It only accepts ascii characters between the ' ' (Space) and '}'. Though this is could be easily changed at the Initializer class.
It does not support unicode strings.
